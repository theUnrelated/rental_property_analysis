# Analysis of Rental Property
Data was first obtained via scrapping with selenium and saved to excel file (looking back, I probably should have used csv instead..)
Data was then cleaned, processed. 
They are then further processed with [Google Geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for finding distances, coordinates etc.
